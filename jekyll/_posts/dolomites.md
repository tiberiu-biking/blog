Dolomites

It has been a dream of mine to spend a few days in the Dolomites mountains. I've heard so many things about the place and had really high expectations, which is always a bad idea when it comes to travelling, as it depends on a lot of things and sometimes on the those things is your state of mind. 
So I did a minimum amount of research and found out that one the good places to stay is Cortina d'Ampezzo, so I decided to settle my headquarters there and do day hikes around that place. Found a very cheap B&B
