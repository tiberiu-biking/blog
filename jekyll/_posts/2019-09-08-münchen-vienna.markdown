### Day  #1 Munich - Erding - Dingolfing 111 km

 Grey sky and cold weather for the whole ride. Started in Dornach, the picked up my comrades from Erding and stopped for an amazing lunch at Stausee. Pumpkin soup, salat, fish Frikadelle, some dessert with plums and a more than decent coffee for 15 euro. The Landshut WeiÃŸbier was ok. Small detour in Landshut to buy a pair of leg warmers, how didnâ€™t I see this coming? Summer is over, means 12 degrees, halloooo!?! 17 euros leg warmers from Decathlon should do the trick for now. The last 30 km were mostly through wild paths, we saw exactly one couple the whole way. Arrived quite late in what I just learned is the biggest BMW plants(270k cars per year). And what better way to finish such a day than with a glorious dinner at McDonalds? Impressed by the Mc veggie burger I must say. Legs are a bit tired, butt seems to be the weak spot for now, still no damaged done. Tomorrow the weather looks rather unfriendly, hopefully we can avoid the rain on our way to Passau.

### Day #2 Dingolfing - Passau 98 km

Day started with an never ending autumn drizzle, but got better in the second half, even got some sun in the evening. The Danube bike path is way better and more interesting and picturesque than the Isar one. Didnâ€™t get then chance to see the Isar delta as the bike path is under construction. Arrived in Passau quite late to find a very pretty town. The equipment handle the harsh weather quite well, really impressed with the Endura jacket and the Ortlieb bags. Legs are still fine, butt is also getting better, today the shoulders were the weak spot. Refueled with carbs at the local Indian restaurant for tomorrowâ€™s ride to Linz. Looking forward to the Linzer Torte!

### Day #3 Passau - Linz 96 km

The day started perfectly with a fabulous breakfast in the same room where the likes of Gorbachov or Neil Armstrong once enjoyed their morning coffee. Perfect weather when leaving the wonderful city of Passau, definitely a place to revisit. Amazing how fast the body can adapt to pain, couldnâ€™t feel any in the morning, just the pure joy of being alive and kicking. The Danube bike path is rather a highway for bikes, amazing infrastructure and asphalt, sometimes even 2 bikepaths on the same side of the river. Had an aaa-maaaa-ziiing coffee and a Linzner cake along the way and a cinnamon roll to go at speciality coffee shop in the middle of nowhere. Refuelled with carbs at the place where the Danube does a U-turn. Hey, even got to use my sun glasses, who said the weather is bad here!?! Oh wait, it was me. The weather went to shit afterwards and it rained for most of the time till Linz. Had to use the ferry to cross the river cause we decided to ignore the signs. Entered the city of Linz on an awful weather and I must say I donâ€™t like the city, even thoug it's the home of gummibÃ¤rchen. Legs are tired, butt is beyond repair. Tomorrow we are heading towards Melk, looking forward to another day of rain.

### Day #4 Linz - Melk 114 km

The good morning coffee was supposed to be a sign of a good day. But the weather decided to teach us another lesson, so we left the city of Linz in pouring rain. After 20 km my not really waterproof shoe covers failed me completely and this broke my faith to a point when I was really close to giving up. But with the amazing support of my biking bodies, to whom I am forever grateful, and after a hot coffee, I manage to continue. Itâ€™s funny how, after spending a small fortune on equipment, two garbage bags and a pair of Decathlon leg warmers saved my ass. The rain stopped and we managed to reach Grain, just to find most of the restaurants closed and to enjoy something I would never call lunch, even by german Kantine standards. Took again the wrong side of the Danube, so we had to cycle for a while for on a national road, being overtaken by trucks is always fun and mostly safe. Managed to get again on the Danube bike path and again amazed by the infrastructure and the quality of the roads. After a veryyyy long day in the saddle, we entered Melk with an awesome view of the monastery in front of a bulk of rainy clouds. Had an amazing dinner and meet  the most funniest Romanian waiter - Jane!. Amazing monastery beer! Pedalling has become more natural than walking, still my butt is complaining. Lesson learned: never save on rain equipment! Buy f###ng GoreTex and live happily ever after. Tomorrow is the queen stage of the trip, so Vienna, start roasting that coffee, we are on our way!

### Day 5: Melk - Vienna 127 km

The last, the hardest and the best day of the trip. Left early the beautiful city of Melk, strolling through the Wachau wine valley. Small villages, vineyards and lots of sun made this the best part of the whole trip. After that, the road becomes rather boring and the long way to Vienna took itâ€™s toll on our pace and strength. No cash is a no go, just another lesson we learned. We struggled to come up with 30 euros to pay for lunch and found out the hard way that buying Apfelschorle without cash is rather impossible in Austria. When we thought we made it, one of my cranks fell off. This repeated 3 times till the train station, just to have undoubtful reasons I need another bike. Entering the city of Vienna is really impressive, offering some spectacular views of the city. Crossed the city to the main train station during rush hour is a challenge on its own. Now taking the midnight train to Georgia back home. This concludes an amazing adventure, my first of this kind, but already looking forward to the next one!
