I was flirting with the idea of a new bike for a while now. I knew exactly what I wanted or at least I thought I knew: endurance carbon frame because why not #richbitch, full Ultegra, definitely from a store where I could try/see/get advice, minimum 28 mm tyres, wide fancy super cool wheels(but not too wide for peopel to confuse me with one of the rich kids of Munich), a price below an arm and a leg.  

First option was of course Specialized, cool bikes and they have a store in Munich. After a deeper look into the matter and a even deeper one into my bank account, I realised I need a better job and moved on. Canyon no, as I already did the mistake of buying a way to bif of a bike online. Cube not fancy enough. Cannondale maybe. Trek no as it has it was once related to the biggest cheater in the history of cycling. Bianchi no as I cannot pay for a bike in lila or whatever that f###ng color is.

It seemed that this would be harder than I thought. Until one blessed day when I saw a Rose bike in an amazing blue and black, simple, but elegant and then is when I knew she is the one. Went to the Rose Bikes store, saw it, liked it, ordered it. The ordering process is pretty cool, they measure everything to get the sizes right and you can customize your bike on a big touchscreen. The guy seemed to know what he was talking about and after one hour of talking about how big my butt is and why am I such a Weichei, the order was placed.

72 days later I got the email saying my bike is ready to be picked up. Then I needed another appointment to pick it up, which was 5 days later, wilkommen in Deutschland. Picking up the bike made me feel like a movie star: the bike was in a glass cube, the lights went on and there she was. Omg. Omg. Omg.
